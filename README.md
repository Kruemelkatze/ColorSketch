# ColorSketch
A simple approach to generate inked color sketches from natural images. This happens in three steps:
* **Segmentation**: The image is split into segments using *Mean Shift Segmentation*
* **Inking Mask**: Dark, correlated patches or outlines are extracted from the image.
* **Inking**: All dark patches are "inked" (colored black) in the segmented image.

## Variants
The code includes handles for some basic settings:
* Inking can produce either outlines or patches
* Inking can be done on the original or the segmented image.
* 3 types of grayscale conversions and switchable contrast enhancement (both really impact the end results!)
* Some global fine-tuning parameters and lots of parameters hidden in the code (see them as a kind of easter eggs [the classic, edible ones])
